## Summary

Clickjacking, a subset of UI redressing, is a malicious technique whereby a web user is deceived into interacting (in most cases by clicking) with something other than what the user believes they are interacting with. This type of attack, either alone or in conjunction with other attacks, could potentially send unauthorized commands or reveal confidential information while the victim is interacting with seemingly-harmless web pages. The term clickjacking was coined by Jeremiah Grossman and Robert Hansen in 2008.

A clickjacking attack uses seemingly-harmless features of HTML and JavaScript to force the victim to perform undesired actions, such as clicking an invisible button that performs an unintended operation. This is a client-side security issue that affects a variety of browsers and platforms.

## How to Test

As mentioned above, this type of attack is often designed to allow an attacker to induce usersâ€™ actions on the target site, even if anti-CSRF tokens are being used. Testing should be conducted to determine if website pages are vulnerable to clickjacking attacks.

Testers may investigate if a target page can be loaded in an inline frame by creating a simple web page that includes a frame containing the target web page. An example of HTML code to create this testing web page is displayed in the following snippet:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Clickjack test page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <iframe src="http://www.target.site" width="500" height="500"></iframe>
    </body>
</html>
```

If the `http://www.target.site` page is successfully loaded into the frame, then the site is vulnerable and has no type of protection against clickjacking attacks.
