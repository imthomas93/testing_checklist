## Summary

Account takeover is a form of identity theft and fraud, where a malicious third party successfully gains access to a userâ€™s account credentials. By posing as the real user, a third party can change account details, send out phishing emails, steal financial information or sensitive data, or use any stolen information to access further accounts within the organization.

## How to Test

### Session Hijacking
Use an authorized cookie to access the authorised and authenticated account

### Password attack
Enumerate for legitimate usernames, and perform password attacks on the found usernames
